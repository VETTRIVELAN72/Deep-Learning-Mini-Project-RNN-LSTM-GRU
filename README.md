# Deep-Learning-Mini-Project-RNN-LSTM-GRU
Ever wondered how machines remember the past while predicting the future?  I recently built a hands-on deep learning notebook exploring Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, and GRU — the foundation of sequence modeling used in NLP and time-series forecasting.
# RNN, LSTM & GRU – Deep Learning for Sequential Data

This project provides a practical and conceptual understanding of
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**,
and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** — three fundamental deep learning
architectures used for modeling **sequential data**.

The notebook explains core concepts, challenges with vanilla RNNs,
and how LSTM and GRU overcome those limitations.
